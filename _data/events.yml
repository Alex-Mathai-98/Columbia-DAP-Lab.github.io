    The one-day workshop to brought together over 200 industry leaders, Columbia faculty and students, 
    and technologists who are interested in the concept of AI agents.
    
    Speakers and panelists come from enterprises that are deploying agentic solutions, technologists 
    and infrastructure leaders, and researchers at leading AI labs as well as Columbia. 
    These include [Jason Wei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-wei-5a7323b0/) from OpenAI who led 
    their chain-of-thought and agentic work, Danielle Perszyk from Amazon AGI, Jonathan Frankle 
    from Databricks, Deepak Dastrala from Intellect, [Cong Yu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/congyu) 
    who leads AI at Celonis, and more.

- title: "Efficient Fine-Tuning and Compression of Large Language Models: Towards Low-bit and Ultra-Low Parameter Solutions"
  date: "2025-07-07"
  description: >
    Efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial due to their substantial memory
    and computational demands. This seminar discusses recent advancements in techniques aimed at 
    significantly reducing these costs, enabling effective adaptation of large-scale models even on
    resource-constrained hardware. The talk will begin with an overview of current challenges and
    mainstream approaches to compressing and fine-tuning LLMs, highlighting trade-offs between 
    model size, accuracy, and efficiency. Subsequently, the speaker will introduce novel approaches 
    that enable fine-tuning at extremely low precision and ultra-low parameter regimes, 
    significantly reducing memory requirements without compromising performance. Finally, the 
    discussion will cover recent progress and future directions for achieving efficient deployment 
    of LLMs in real-world applications.

- title: "Multi-Agent Systems in the Era of LLMs: Testbeds, Applications, and Beyond"
  date: "2025-07-10"
  description: >
    Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are emerging as powerful tools for a 
    wide range of tasks. However, a single agent often faces performance ceilings, especially when 
    tackling complex workflows like running an AI company or AI4Research, and is inherently limited 
    in scenarios that involve multiple instances, such as simulations, embodied agents, and digital 
    twins. In this talk, I will present Multi-Agent Large Language Models (MA-LLMs), a promising 
    paradigm designed to overcome the fundamental limitations of single-agent systems. I will begin 
    by highlighting three threads of my previous work that lay the groundwork for MA-LLMs. Next, 
    I'll introduce our research on fairness summarization, which demonstrates challenges that a 
    single agent struggles to handle well. Then, I will present how agents can collaborate in a 
    chain-of-agent manner to solve difficult tasks, such as long-document summarization and 
    multi-step reasoning. Finally, I will reflect on current limitations in MA-LLMs and outline my 
    long-term vision of building Agent Societies: a human-centric society consisting of scalable, 
    trustworthy, and collaborative intelligent agents and humans.

- title: "The Road to High-Quality LLM Inference Services: System, Data, and Context"
  date: "2025-07-17"
  description: >
    This talk is about sharing the experience of building enterprise LLM inference services including
    (1) high-level principles of increasing performance and saving costs
    (2) a data selection algorithm to finetune LLM to increase the accuracy of domain-specific questions
    (3) a method to enhance users' prompt with domain-specific  knowledge bases.

- title: "From Serving LLMs to Serving Agents on the Cloud"
  date: "2025-07-24"
  description: >
    In this talk, I will discuss key challenges in building agentic AI systems in the cloud. 
    I will highlight DeltaZip, our recent work on efficiently deploying multiple fine-tuned models 
    -- a step we believe is essential toward enabling future AI systems. The core insight behind 
    DeltaZip is that fine-tuning often introduces small-magnitude changes to a pre-trained model. 
    By co-designing the serving system and compression algorithm, DeltaZip achieves a 2x to 12x 
    throughput improvement over state-of-the-art systems. In addition to this project, I will share 
    some ongoing challenges we are tackling in this space.
