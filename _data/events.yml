- title: Multi-Agent Systems in the Era of LLMs: Testbeds, Applications, and Beyond
  author: Yusen Zhang 
  date: 7/10/25 
  desc: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are emerging as powerful tools for a wide range of tasks. However, a single agent often faces performance ceilings, especially when tackling complex workflows like running an AI company or AI4Research, and is inherently limited in scenarios that involve multiple instances, such as simulations, embodied agents, and digital twins. In this talk, I will present Multi-Agent Large Language Models (MA-LLMs), a promising paradigm designed to overcome the fundamental limitations of single-agent systems. I will begin by highlighting three threads of my previous work that lay the groundwork for MA-LLMs. Next, Iâ€™ll introduce our research on fairness summarization, which demonstrates challenges that a single agent struggles to handle well. Then, I will present how agents can collaborate in a chain-of-agent manner to solve difficult tasks, such as long-document summarization and multi-step reasoning. Finally, I will reflect on current limitations in MA-LLMs and outline my long-term vision of building Agent Societies: a human-centric society consisting of scalable, trustworthy, and collaborative intelligent agents and humans.
