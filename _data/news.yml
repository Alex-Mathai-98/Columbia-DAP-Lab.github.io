    Spring 2025 [Agentic System Made Real](https://w6113.github.io/) Course
  content: >
    LLMs have opened new possibilities of automated agents that plan and complete tasks on the 
    user's behalf. Such agents have the potential to usher in a new industrial revolution by 
    automating organizational processes. This graduate-level course will cut across the technology 
    stack to examine the research questions that need to be answered for agents to be possible in 
    real tasks that matter. Each session will review 1-3 papers or systems, and discuss research 
    opportunities that arise from the gap between existing research and enterprise requirements. 
    Topics will span systems (data systems and ML systems), AI (LLMs, agent-based planning), HCI, 
    and theory (reinforcement learning, markets).
