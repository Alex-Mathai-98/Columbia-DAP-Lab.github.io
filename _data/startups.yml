  bio: Tom Effland is the technical founder and CTO of Noetica AI, a fast-growing VC-backed Series A startup. The company's AI-powered knowledge platform helps many top law firms improve outcomes in valuable corporate debt, securities, and M&A transactions. Before founding Noetica, Tom earned his PhD in Computer Science from Columbia University. He was advised by Prof. Michael Collins and received support from a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

    This talk shares lessons learned going from NLP researcher to building Noetica, a platform that analyzes populations of complex contracts to determine market standards for deal terms. Along the way I'll discuss (1) how LLMs have enabled a new opportunity space for hybrid systems that combine extraction capabilities with formal analytical frameworks, (2) how building these systems still requires deep fusion of subject-matter and technical judgment to identify tractable decompositions of seemingly impossible problems, and (3) how this converges to a new version of the Technical Product Manager role. This role is highly suited to technical researchers willing to tackle sector-specific challenges.

  bio: Thomas Bueler-Faudree is the co-founder of August, where he leads engineering and product. He earned a bachelor's degree in computer science and history from Columbia University. At Columbia he worked in the CRIS Lab and CML.

    Modern document-heavy work in law, finance, and consulting is repetitive, bespoke, and review heavy. Code generation tools like Cursor have reshaped how developers work, but that shift has not happened in law. Legal tasks are hard to measure and even harder to "unit test," which is why many AI tools miss the mark.

    This talk shows how August is building agents that do better: the right indexing methods, visible state, disciplined tool use, and citations at every step to cleanly automate real professional workflows. We'll walk through a multi-step research agent (e.g., over SEC filings) that plans the task, retrieves the right sources, routes to the relevant sections, and drafts grounded legal answers.

    Attendees will leave with a lightweight design pattern for credence domains like law. We will also share our growth and go-to-market. We are productizing law-firm workflows and, in some cases, selling with the firm to their clients. This is a new model that is gaining traction across professional services.
