## Positions at the DAPLab

### Postdoc Research Position

**DAPlab ‚Äì Columbia University**  
**Location:** New York, NY  
**Supervisors:** Columbia DAPLab Faculty (including Prof. Zhou Yu and Prof. Eugene Wu)

The **Data, Agents, and Processes Lab (DAPLab)** at Columbia University is seeking a **Postdoctoral Researcher** to advance the next generation of AI agents that operate within organizations‚Äîsystems that perceive, reason, and act in dynamic, interactive environments.

This position offers an exciting opportunity to work at the intersection of **machine learning** and **systems research**, under the broad supervision of DAPLab faculty. Our goal is to develop intelligent, user-aligned agents by bridging large-scale data processing, systems development, interaction design, and learning-based adaptation.

#### üîç Research Focus

We are particularly interested in candidates who can contribute to projects across:

- **AI agent infrastructure**: building scalable, efficient systems to support and leverage agent training, inference, and workflows  
- **User modeling and simulation** for agent personalization and evaluation  
- **Reinforcement learning and LLM fine-tuning** for dynamic adaptation  
- **Human-AI interaction and usability** in real-world decision-making  
- **Agent orchestration**, including tool use, memory, and feedback loops  

This role is ideal for researchers excited about combining ML algorithms, systems design, and human-centered AI to develop **generalizable and trustworthy agents**.
