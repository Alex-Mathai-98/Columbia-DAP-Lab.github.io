Agents have the potential to transform how humans, companies, and economies function, yet also introduce systemic risks at every level of technology and society.

The goal of the DAPLab is to pursue research to make agent-based automation accountable, reliable, and efficient, and thus trusted within organizations.

The lab pursues this vision by combining expertise across systems (OS, data, cloud), AI (ML, RL, NLP, computer vision, robotics), human-computer interaction, and operations research.
