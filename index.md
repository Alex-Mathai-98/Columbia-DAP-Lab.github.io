DAPLab is a group of Columbia faculty and their PhD students at the forefront of applied research on Data, Agents and Processes (DAP).
Agents have the potential to transform how humans, companies, and economies function, yet also introduce systemic risks at every level of technology and society.

The goal of the DAPLab is to pursue research to make agent-based automation accountable, reliable, and efficient, and thus trusted within organizations.

The lab pursues this vision by combining expertise across systems (OS, data, cloud), AI (ML, RL, NLP, computer vision, robotics), human-computer interaction, and operations research.

</div>

The Data, Agents, and Processes Lab at Columbia University is organizing a one-day workshop to bring together industry leaders, Columbia faculty and students, and technologists who are interested in the concept of AI agents.

Speakers and panelists come from enterprises that are deploying agentic solutions, technologists and infrastructure leaders, and researchers at leading AI labs as well as Columbia. These include [Jason Wei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-wei-5a7323b0/) from OpenAI who led their chain-of-thought and agentic work, Danielle Perszyk from Amazon AGI, Jonathan Frankle from Databricks, Deepak Dastrala from Intellect, [Cong Yu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/congyu) who leads AI at Celonis, and more.
